# Golang Backend Example

This Go [(Golang)](https://go.dev/) backend example project implements a [RESTful API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/) for managing posts. Users can sign up, log in, create, retrieve, update, and delete posts using the provided endpoints. The application utilizes JSON payloads for data exchange and employs JWT tokens for secure authentication and authorization. With basic CRUD functionality and user authentication, it offers a flexible and secure solution for managing posts in a web environment.
