# Golang Backend Example

This Go [(Golang)](https://go.dev/) backend example project implements a [RESTful API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/) for managing posts. Users can sign up, log in, create, retrieve, update, and delete posts using the provided endpoints. The application utilizes JSON payloads for data exchange and employs JWT tokens for secure authentication and authorization. With basic CRUD functionality and user authentication, it offers a flexible and secure solution for managing posts in a web environment.

## Usage
I used [Fly.io](https://fly.io) to deploy and host this project. You can do the same if you want to host it on your own system.
First, clone this Git repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/safzanpirani/go_exampleBE
```
Move into the newly created directory:
```bash
cd go_exampleBE
```
Install flyctl in order to host this repository on Fly.io by running:
```bash
powershell -Command "iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex"
```
